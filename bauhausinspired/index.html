			<h3>Discussion on my creation, "Sunshine", in relation to the Laszlo postcard</h3>
			<p> The work I have been inspired by is called "Provenance".  It is object number 1987.77 in the Harvard Brauhaus collection.  It is originally from the The Fredric Wertham Collection, gift of his wife Hesketh; to the Busch-Reisinger Museum, 1987.<p>
			<p>The artist, László Moholy-Nagy, was a professor in the Bauhaus school. He was a painter and photographer, originally from Hungary.  The artist also created works in the Avant Garde movement.  I find this movement and it's works very interesting. I like this piece in particular as, I believe, it is representative of the Russian Avant Garde movement.<p>
			<p>I gravitated towards this piece because of the beautiful balance of shapes and color across the canvas. The shapes are balanced uniformly across the canvas.  However, the tone across is grey and dark, contrasted by 2 light/brighter shapes on the lower right that seem to balance the darkness but take only about 30 percent of the space. I have strived to create a similar effect in my creation, however in a different way.  My canvas is stark and white, balanced by the strong contrast of a mix of shapes and bright colors on the right that also take about 30 percent of the space. I have also been influenced by a second artwork by László Moholy-Nagy (a print called Suprematistic created in 1925) in my creation. It has a similar balance. My color choices have been more influenced by this work. This print is not part of the Harvard collection. It is shown below.<p>
